            Lauren, Happy Valentines Day and I love you so much.
            Thank you for all you do for me and my little man. You're
            so sweet baby. I wish I was at a point in my life where I
            could do more for you.
        </p>

        <p class="intro__text">
            I just need you to know that I truly do love you from the
            bottom of my heart. I mean it and I care about you. I
            will do anything for you at anytime. I will always be yours
            Lauren. I give you my heart, my soul, and my mind. I want to
            be with you.
        </p>

        <i> Love, Justin A. Mayanrd</i>
