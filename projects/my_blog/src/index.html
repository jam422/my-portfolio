            Have you been going through a difficult time with marriage, girlfriend, bodyfriend, or
            whatever? Well, I know just where you're coming from. I never understood the difficulties
            of a relationship. When I first got married six years ago, I was still happy and had all
            kinds of funny feelings for my wife. But, those feelings, well they soon dissapate and
            when they do its hard to overcome hardships in a relationship.
        </p>
        <p>
            Well, this is what I have been experincing for about the last two-three years, maybe? I want to share
            my story with Dad's who have been seperated from their spouse. Not only the spouse, but sometimes
            there are children involved... Unfortunately, My wife and I have a four year old son. I moved out two
            months ago and being away from your child is the hardest thing I've ever done in my life. I get to see
            him once a week and every other weekend so it's not too bad, but still I feel like a "weekend Dad", or
            someting.
        </p>
        <p>
            Well, enough blabbing if you look below I posted some pictures of my family just so you get a feel
            for who I am I guess. Don't forget to read the blog as well. Over on my <a href="blog.html">blog</a>
            you can leave comments if you'd like after you're done reading and I'll be sure to respond. Thank you
            and have a blessed day/night, wherever you are <i class="fa fa-smile-o fa-1x" aria-hidden="true"></i>
