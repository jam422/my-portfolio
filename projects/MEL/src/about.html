     <!-- TESTIMONIALS -->
     <div class="test-container">
            <p><span>83-Year-Old Betty</span>Resident for a year and a half.</p>
            <p class="test__paragraph">                    
                    She became interested in the residence after learning that it was an
                    all-senior community, finding it very clean and friendly
                    Since moving in the self-proclaimed retired home
                    maker is feeling safer than ever in her cloister of fellow
                    seniors. Betty says she is impressed with how well the
                    grounds and common areas are kept, but it seems she
                    is happiest with her new rhythm of life at Mel Hasty. In
                    her neighborhood, Betty plays in several card clubs
                    and often can be found at the Fond Du Lac Administration
                    Building, attending many of their senior events. Within
                    the building, she's kept busy with Bingo, potlucks, and
                    musical events. Even though she has plenty to do at Mel
                    Hasty, she likes the convenience of having all she needs
                    in the neighborhood: grocery and drug stores, restau
                    rants, gas stations, the local library, the fitness center
                    across the street, and access to a major highway when
                    the adventurous spirit strikes.

            <p><span>73-Year-Old Bill</span>Resident for 10 years </p>
            <p class="test__paragraph">
                    This former restaurant manager likes to keep busy
                    working out and partaking of the various activities around
                    the residence, but he was initially drawn in by the build
                    ing's convenient proximity to many community locations
                    Bill is pretty keen on the computer room, where he can
                    surf the internet at his convenience, and he says the com
                    mon room is not only well appointed, but well kept. For
                    him, the laundry room is a big plus, but the most pleasing
                    thing he finds about the location isn't the features, it's the
                    changes he's experienced since taking up residence, Bull
                    describes himself as a loner before he took up residence,
                    but it didn't take him long to take up with a tev
                    residents he is now proud to call his friends,

                <p><span>86-Year-Old Julia</span>Resident for 6 years.</p>
                <p class="test__paragraph">                    
                        The former bookkeeper, restaurant manager, and home nurse seems to have done it all and
                        even found time to raise five children. She shows no
                        sign of slowing down either. On top of painting, sewing
                        drawing, cooking, and Bible study, Julia manages to tear
                        through 6 to 12 books a week that's in addition to
                        hosting an arts and crafts workshop in her apartment
                        each week! What initially sparked Julia's interest in
                        moving to Mel Hasty was its convenient location within
                        the community and the look of the home and grounds
                        she thought it looked so well kept and maintained
                        that she returned for a second stay!
